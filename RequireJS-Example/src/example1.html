    <h3>Using require() vs. define()</h3>
    <p>
        Earlier I mentioned that we can use both require() and define() to load dependencies.<br />
        Understanding the difference between those two functions is essential to managing dependencies.<br />
        The require() function is used to run immediate functionalities, while define() is used to define modules for use in multiple locations.<br />
        In our example we need to run the purchaseProduct() function immediately. So, require() was used inside main.js.<br />
        However, the other files are reusable modules and therefore use define().
